🛡️ What Is an Anti-Cheat?
An anti-cheat is a system that detects and blocks cheaters in a game.

It looks for:

People using scripts, exploits, or hacks

Behavior that’s not possible normally in the game

Tools that try to bypass game rules

Think of it like a security guard for your game. If someone tries to break in with cheats, the anti-cheat catches them and shuts them down — or reports them.

If you’re not cheating, you won’t be affected.
If you are cheating, you’ll wish you hadn’t.

⚠️ Reminder:
If you don’t know what an anti-cheat is or how it works…
Then RBXDefender is not for you.
This is a developer-grade tool, not a plug-and-play toy from the toolbox.
If you install it without understanding, don’t come crying when your game breaks — read the instructions or don’t use it.
